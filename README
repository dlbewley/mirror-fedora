A script to update a Fedora mirror. 

Avoids "null rsyncs" by using MirrorManager rsyncFilter feature, so it
only syncs directories containing content which has changed since the 
last successful run:
 https://www.redhat.com/mailman/private/mirror-list-d/2009-April/msg00007.html

Report_mirror is called after a successful sync, so be sure to configure URL
and password in /etc/mirrormanager-client/report_mirror.conf

Find an upstream mirror to rsync from, and adjust the variables in the script.
If you are running a public mirror you should ask a tier 1 mirror for private
access.

This script has not been tested since numerous changes were made!

The long list of rsync args used were culled from the mirror list over time,
if you have any suggestions or complaints let me know.
