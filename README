A script to update a Fedora mirror. 

= NOTE! =

This script has not been tested since numerous changes were made!

= Getting Started =

* Make sure you have enough space. 
How much space do you need?

See http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/DIRECTORY_SIZES.txt

* Get yourself a Fedora login.

See https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/

* Become a mirror by registering a site and a host with Fedora MirrorManager.

See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Mirroring

* Find an upstream mirror to rsync from. 

If you are running a public mirror you should ask a tier 1 mirror for 
private rsync access.

Once you have a upstream rsync host and credentials, adjust the variables in the
mirror-fedora script.

See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Mirroring/Tiering

* Enable MirrorManager reporting.

Install the mirrormanager-client tool and set your URL
and password in /etc/mirrormanager-client/report_mirror.conf

After syncing, The contents of your mirror are reported back to Fedora so others
can be directed to the closes mirror of the content they are seeking.

See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/MirrorManager

= Usage =

* See getting started section above.
* chmod 755 /etc/cron.d/mirror-fedora and enjoy.

== Notifying  MirrorManager ==

Report_mirror is called after a successful sync, so be sure to install
mirror-manager-client, and to configure URL
and password in /etc/mirrormanager-client/report_mirror.conf

== Null rsyncs ==

We can avoid "null rsyncs", as Matt Domsch calles them, by using the
MirrorManager rsyncFilter feature, which lists all directories changed since
an arbitrary time.

Syncs may only run on directories containing content which has changed since
the last successful run.

See  https://www.redhat.com/mailman/private/mirror-list-d/2009-April/msg00007.html

Unfortunately the above is only useful for tier 1 mirrors. Because it presents 
the list of recent changes on the tier 0 mirrors. You are probably
a tier 2, so this feature could lead to your mirror becoming inconsistent with
tier 0.

It fix for this problem, has been suggested to be a feature which would
support a query argument identifying one's upstream mirror.

It was deamed that this methodology was more trouble that it was worth.

== Rsync tweaks ==

The long list of rsync args used were culled from the mirror list over time.
It contains arguments designed to present a consistent view of your mirror
to users even during an active rsync.

If you have any suggestions or complaints let me know.
